This project focuses on cryptocurrency data analytics, leveraging AWS technologies to create a scalable, serverless ETL pipeline. We will extract data from Alpha Vantage, transform it using AWS Lambda, and load it into DynamoDB. Further analytics will be performed using Apache Flink, Apache Zeppelin, and Amazon Athena.
